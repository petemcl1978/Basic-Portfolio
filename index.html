        <h1> Pete McLaughlin</h1>
    <p1>My name is Pete Mclaughlin. I am 40 for most of my employable life I have worked retail or customer service in one form or another. Currently I work as a Digital Specialist. In this role I assist customers to download the products that they have purchased. The content that we carry are Ebooks, Mp3 music downloads, video downloads as well as audiobooks and streaming video content. Over the years I have thought of escaping this trap that is customer service with each thought or attempt it seemed more and more difficult to escape. I have thought about web development in the past and attempted the self teaching method and got no where with it. When I saw this program it rekindled the spark of interest in programing.</p1>

    <p2>I am a father to two boys, my oldest  Cameron is 13 and my youngest Zachary is 10. Recently we have also added my girlfriend Janna and her son Bennett to the family.  I have signed up for this class to change careers and to better my family. I know there is a better income potential as well as the ability to work this sort of job from any place in the world . One of my goals is to be able to relocate to Ireland. Having traveled there with my girlfriend we have found that this is where we best fit. I would like to find a job programming over in the Emerald Isle. </p2>
